# The Written Analysis

## Overview of the project: 

Steve now wants to expand the dataset to encompass the entire stock market over the previous five years in order to undertake some further study for his parents. In this anaylsis I'll write code to cycle over all of the data once to capture the same information Then I will see if correctly restructuring ymy code helped the VBA script run quicker.   

## Results: 

###### 2017-All stock Analysis: 

The code ran 0.21875 seconds for the year 2017. The All stock Analysis for 2017 shows that the TERP return is negative -7.2% compare to the others. The others Ticker returns from 2017 are postive.

2017 analysis had a postive stock performance and only one Ticker was negative compare to others postive tickers that performed well. But on other side 2018 stock performace was not good and All of their tickers were negative compare to the two tickers. 

## Summary: 

###### Advantages of Refactoring code:

Refactoring is an important step in the coding process. When you restructure code, you aren't adding new functionality; instead, you aim to make the code more efficientâ€”by doing fewer steps, using less memory, or enhancing the logic of the code to make it simpler to comprehend for future users. 

###### Disadvantages of Refactoring Code: 

First efforts at coding aren't usually the ideal approach to complete a task, refactoring is prevalent on the job.Refactoring someone else's code might often be your first step towards working with existing code at a company. 

###### Pros and Cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script: 

These Pros and cons do apply to the the orginal Refactoring VBA script. Steve loved the workbook we prepared for him before. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. So the pros's to this VBA script was that We made the code more efficient, whether it means completing fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier to understand For Steve. And the cons to this VBA script was that first attempts at coding aren't always the best way to achieve a task.
